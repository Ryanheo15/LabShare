Trivial/Insignificant:
- Figure out typeahead for forms
- Bootstrap jumbotron for front page?
- Delete unnecessary files
    - javascripts?
- Sass?
- use include for static html components? (footers, main navbar)
- favicon

Should do:
- Organize php files
- Change code to private later on
- Inventory search bar
- Inventory edit / delete buttons

Notes for future coding:
- Make sure paths are case-sensitive (for bluehost)
- Keep imports updated (Bootstrap 4.4.1)
