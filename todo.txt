Trivial/Insignificant:
- Remove app.js file (Scrollspy) because of new Scrollspy implementation that does not require it.
- Figure out typeahead for forms
- Bootstrap jumbotron for front page?
- Delete unnecessary files
    - helpful-links
    - javascripts?
- Sass?
- use include for static html components? (footers, main navbar)
- favicon

Should do:
- Organize php files
    - have a global php file with functions and variables to import
- Change code to private later on

Notes for future coding:
- Make sure paths are case-sensitive (for bluehost)
- Keep imports updated
